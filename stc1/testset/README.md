# Test set for NTCIR-12 STC Japanese subtask

This is the data set of tweets used in the formal run of NTCIR-12 STC
Japanese subtask.

- `test-final.txt`: The set of tweets used for the formal run.  The
  file is slightly modified from the original one delivered to
  participants; the tweets deleted before the formal run deadline was
  eliminated.
- `test-final-labeled.txt.gz`: Tweet pairs labeled by crowdsourcing.
  The first column (tweet A) comes from `test-final.txt`, while the
  second column comes from submitted runs.  The data format is the
  same as the development set.
