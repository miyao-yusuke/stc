# Shared Task on Short Text Conversation

This repository provides the datasets for NTCIR STC (Short Text Conversation)
Japanese subtask.  For the details of the shared task, refer to the
[STC homepage](http://ntcir12.noahlab.com.hk/stc.htm).

## Provided datasets

- `taskdata`: Data from which tweets are to be retrieved. 
  Provided tweets were randomly sampled from all the tweets in 2014
  (1 million tweets; .5 million tweet pairs).
- `devset`: Development data.  For each input tweet, a baseline system
  retrieved tweets from `taskdata`.  Each tweet pair is labeled by 10
  annotators.
